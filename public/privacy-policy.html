        <p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">6.1 We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">6.1.1 Data transfers: we use servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this Privacy Policy and the European requirements for the transfer of your information, as outlined above.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">6.1.2 If GDPR applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this Privacy Policy so you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information.

        <p class="c6"><span class="c0">6.2 We process your information for the purposes described in this policy,&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">based on these legal grounds</span><span class="c2 c0">:</span></p>

        <p class="c7"><span class="c3">7. COOKIES</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">7.1 We use cookies and similar technologies such as local storage within our apps to provide and optimize our Service. You can control which cookies you get and which you keep on your device through your browser settings. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse our cookies, our system will issue cookies when you visit our website. However, if you do not accept cookies you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Service.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">7.2 We use cookies to keep track of the pages you and other users have been to on our Service. Cookies enable us to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of our Service more convenient (e.g. by remembering your user preferences).</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">7.3 You can disable cookies on your device or set your device to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c3">8. LINKS</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">Our Service may contain links to and from other websites and Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third-party sites. Please check the individual Privacy Policy of any such websites or Services before you submit any personal information to them.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c3">9. ADVERTISERS</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">Please note that we show third party advertising in our games and also advertise our Services via third parties. We wanted to provide you with more detail about how we use the information for advertising, both in-game and on other third-party properties.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c3">When you view ads on LBP’s properties</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">To enable us to show in-game ads we may send your advertising ID, IP-address, and other information to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. LBP does not control which specific ads are shown in our games (this is controlled by ad networks) but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes, for example, to:</span></p>
        <ul class="c11 lst-kix_list_8-0 start">
        <li class="c12"><span class="c2 c0">limit the number of times you see the same ad;</span></li>
        <li class="c9"><span class="c2 c0">ensure they are dealing with humans/with real devices and not automated bots;</span></li>
        <li class="c9"><span class="c2 c0">to serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you;</span></li>
        <li class="c5"><span class="c2 c0">other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in LBP’s games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as an intermediary between the other game companies and LBP. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad, and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, installs, and similar events from ads are measured using Advertiser ID.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at the city level.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c3">When you view LBP’s ads on third party services</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">Little Bit Publishing also advertises its games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve its ads to audiences that will be interested in them. The advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes, including, for example, to measure ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs it generates through its advertising in other publishers’ games). Advertising IDs are also used to track views, clicks, installs, and other similar events from ads.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by changing the privacy settings of your device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android).</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c3">10. KEEPING YOUR ACCOUNT SECURE</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">10.1 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and you are responsible for any misuse of such information.
